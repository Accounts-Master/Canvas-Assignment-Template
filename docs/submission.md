# Submission Instructions

For most of our assignments you will be submitting a Google Doc - usually as a PDF of the assignment template, but sometimes as a link to your document (which lets me see and comment on a "live" copy of the document).

But for this assignment, there is nothing to submit - I can see that you've done the assignment when I check Canvas.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead, -->

[slides]: <{{site.data.assignment.slides}}>
[template]: <{{site.data.assignment.template}}>
